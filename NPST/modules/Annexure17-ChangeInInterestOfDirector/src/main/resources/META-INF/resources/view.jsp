				Bio-data of its directors along with their interest in other companies
				and Trustee Bank is required to provide details of interest of
				directors of Axis Bank in other companies every six months or for

			<p>This is to inform you that Mr. Rajesh Dahiya, Executive Director
				(Corporate Centre) and KMP of the Bank, has sought early retirement
				from the services of the Bank, to pursue personal and professional
				interests outside his corporate career.</p>
		
			<p>The Board of Directors (the Board) of the Bank at its meeting
				held today considering the aspirations of Mr. Rajesh Dahiya, accepted
				his decision to seek early retirement from the services of the Bank.
				The said retirement will be effective after expiry of three months
				viz. after the close of business hours on Friday, December 31, 2021.</p>
		
			<p>Mr. Dahiya had joined the Bank in June 2010, after a successful
				stint of 20 years across various group companies of the Tata Group. He
				joined as President - HR and assumed the role of Group Executive -
				Corporate Centre in July 2014 and thereafter assumed charge as the
